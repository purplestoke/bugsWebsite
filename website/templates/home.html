    After every bugs Event 10% of competitors selected split 60% of all Ethereum
    generated from Event Entry Cost Fees. <br /><br />
    20% of Ethereum generated goes to a lucky winner from the community with the highest average score. <br /><br />
    10% of Event Entry Cost Fees are given to participating communitys (per
    competitor)<br /><br />
    The last 10% is retained by bugs.

    <h1>What we do</h1>
    <p>
      bugs is a brand for content creators, streamers and communities. We give
      these communities the option to participate in bugs Events using the
      Discord bot, Stoke. <br /><br />
      Those who invite the Stoke bot into their server give their community
      members the option to compete in a bugs event, where they not only compete
      for themselves but for their community as well. <br /><br />
      All you need to compete in a bugs Event is a Discord account and Ethereum
      wallet. <br /><br />
      Note* bugs DOES NOT support hosted wallets
